# Stories and personas

### Persona 1
Mary is employed inside a company that uses LaTazza system. She is middle aged, married and has two sons. They are five and eight. 
Every morning she drives her children to school and then goes to work: that usually takes her forty minutes. When she gets to the office, she is usually already tired so a coffee is the first thing she thinks of!
Her workday usually implies dealing with people and make speeches. That is what brings her to use capsules a lot: a cup of coffee or tea is always a good way to get along with someone else! 
At the same time, her payroll does not allow her to exploit those occasions as much as she wished.
Once she finishes working, she goes back home, where her children and husband waits for her to dine all together.

### Persona 2
John is the manager of a company that uses LaTazza system. He lives with his girlfriend, with whom he usually argues a lot. 
He always gets to the office before than anyone else to enjoy his coffee in peace. His wish is for all his employees to create a friendly environment at work. That is why he decided to introduce LaTazza system inside
the office: he would like to see relationships growing among his employees. Even if that takes time to be managed he does not mind doing it, for his collegues' sake.
His workday ends very late: once he is home is so tired he goes immediately to sleep.
